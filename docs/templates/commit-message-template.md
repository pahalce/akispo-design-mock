Types: feat | fix | docs | style | refactor | perf | test | build | ci | chore | revert
Notes:
- Use imperative for summary (e.g., "add", "fix") and keep it <= 50 chars.
- Separate summary / body / footer with blank lines; wrap body lines at ~72 chars.
- Prefer explaining "why" before "what"; list key changes as bullets.
